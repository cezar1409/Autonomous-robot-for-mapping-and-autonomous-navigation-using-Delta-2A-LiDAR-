# Autonomous-robot-for-mapping-and-autonomous-navigation-using-Delta-2A-LiDAR-


An autonomous mobile robot system featuring LiDAR-based environmental mapping and real-time navigation capabilities.


This project implements a complete autonomous mobile robot system capable of real-time environmental mapping and navigation using LiDAR technology. The robot integrates a Delta-2A LiDAR sensor with triangulation-based distance measurement for 360Â° environmental scanning across 16 sectors.

 Hardware Components

- **LiDAR Sensor**: Delta-2A with 8-meter range, 360Â° coverage
- **Main Controller**: Raspberry Pi 3B+ (Debian Linux)
- **Motor Controller**: Arduino Mega 2560 with Moebius shield
- **Locomotion**: Mecanum wheel drive system for omnidirectional movement
- **Communication**: USB 3.0 and UART protocols

 Key Features

- **360Â° Environmental Scanning**: Real-time LiDAR mapping with 16-sector coverage
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithms
- **Omnidirectional Movement**: Mecanum wheels enable lateral translation and rotation
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response time for navigation decisions
- **Precise Detection**: 5cm minimum obstacle detection accuracy
